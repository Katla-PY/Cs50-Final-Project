# Cs50-Final-Project
#### Video Demo:  https://youtube.com
#### Description:
For my final project, I decided to make a moderation bot on discord that uses a flask API
to store data on a database with a "many to many relationship" I chose to do it like this,
because I thought it nicely incorporated some of what I learned in CS50.
###### dc_bot:
This folder contains two files. The bot and the requirements as for what the bot does
it's just a simple moderation bot that the staff can use to warn, mute, kick and ban members
that don't follow the rules the bot logs every warn, mute, kick and ban it lets the staff
keep track of what's happening in a more user-friendly way.
###### flask_app:
This folder contains two files. The API and the requirements:
the API is what stores and sends the data to the bot this made it easy to debug and figure out if a bug was in the API or the bot.
